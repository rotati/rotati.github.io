## **Software Testing: Getting the Right Team & Tools**

At Rotati Consulting we take software testing very seriously. For all of our projects, weather they are web or mobile applications, we test, test and test! We provide many layers of testing and we test at many stages of the software development process.

If you want to learn more about software testing you maybe intested in attending our short presentation and open discussion event on Wednesday 20th January 2016, from 6pm at Rotati Villa. Check out the event on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1167059606656122/) and please RSVP!

### **It all starts with the business!**

The first thing that we generally will test for our clients is the business logic that underpins the clients requirements for their application. We will write automated tests for this level using a technology called RSpec. Since these tests are written in Ruby, developers can read the tests and understand the applications specifications. Developers can run these tests on their own development computers to ensure that the software is in stalled and running as expected.

### **Enter the CI Server**

Another testing component is something called the 'CI Server'. CI stands for Continuous Integration and at Rotati we use Codeship for this. What Codeship does for us is they run all the tests for all our projects _every time_ we make a change to the software! That means we continusouly know that the software is still working as expected. For every feature that we add to our projects we will include a corresponding test for that feature so that as complexity grows - the software testing never falls behind.

### **Human Team Testing**

At Rotati we have a team of testers as part of our testing team. It's important to actually have real, human testers since, well, after all, the applications will be used by humans! This is also a process that is carried our continuously at Rotati. The test team leader will derive a testing harness by which to follow for each project. This is a set of manual tests to complete for each project based on the specifications. The testers can test edge cases, try to break the app with unusal activity, check the applications security, test the responsiveness of the user interface in different devices such as mobile or tablet and so on. If this team is happy, then the client should be happy!

### **Learn More about Software Testing with Rotati**
