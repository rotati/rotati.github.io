### Welcome To Rotati

Happy New Year 2015 and Welcome to Rotati!

We here at Rotati and super excited about the New Year! We have a new website, new office and a bunch of trainees going through [DevBootstrap](http://devbootstrap.com) right now.

We are also excited to start using the latest versions of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) (version 4.1) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (version 1.3.8) in all our projects. Both of these frameworks just get better and better and we expect the pace to continue in 2015.

Rotati are also super excited to announce partnerships with lots of local consultancies to ensure we provide the best services to all our clients.

So, once again, lets raise a glass and Happy New Year! We'll see you again very soon.
