        <strong>Course Description:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many development teams try to adopt unit testing, but fail, because their developers do not not how to write testable code. This course not only introduces unit testing and the use of JUnit, but helps developers truly embrace Test-Driven Development, by teaching them how to design their code to be testable, and to embrace a more disciplined workflow. The result should be higher quality products, happy customers, and a happier team, since theyâ€™re spending their time productively creating new features instead of hunting and fixing bugs.
