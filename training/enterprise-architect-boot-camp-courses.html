        This course is meant to prepare senior software developers to assume the role of Enterprise Application Architect, introducing him or her to the heuristics of designing and leading a software project for business applications. The heart of the course are the Enterprise Design Patterns, or known approaches to designing business applications. These cover approaches to designing web components, business-logic components, integration and persistence. The most exciting part of this course is the role playing activity using three case studies. Students are grouped into teams who will then role play as employees of different software companies competing to win contracts for projects. For each case, the students are given a week to design a solution and present these to a panel. The cases are drawn from real-world projects. The panel is composed of top software architects from different companies. Each presentation is critiqued in depth by the panel. The students are able to benefit from the wealth of experience of the panelists.
