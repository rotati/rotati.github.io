        <strong>Course Overview:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This course is an introduction to Java and the most commonly used libraries of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE). The course includes a comprehensive discussion on the best practices and common pitfalls. Students are provided with numerous hands-on graded and ungraded exercises, the most challenging of which is the final machine problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The course culminates in a Code Review, where students present their solutions to the final machine problem to the class, for review and critique by the instructor as well as by the entire class. This activity has been effective in drilling-in proper practices and approaches to the students.
