        <strong>Course Description:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction to Domain-Driven Design</strong><br>
        Improving Applications Design with a Rich Domain Model
      </p>
      <p>
        Most modern systems and applications are developed using object-oriented languages. Object-orientation (OO) is chosen to better tackle complexity. But most complex enterprise Java applications are written using a procedural style. This course aids participants in developing a richer domain model using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) techniques, and balance between the business domain and addressing technological issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        This training course uses lecture, discussion, and classroom exercises, including hands-on coding projects. In discussions, participants have the opportunity to discuss their own experiences, and relate their own work to the principles and techniques presented in the class. All code exercises are written in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        This class was developed and is taught by some of the World' well-known and respected Java software engineers and architects, and uses the format trusted by some of the best companies in the World.
