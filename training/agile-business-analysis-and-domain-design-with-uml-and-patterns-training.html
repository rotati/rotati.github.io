        <strong>Course Description:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This course is applicable for both Business Analysts and Software Engineers to understand the process of <b>transforming business requirements into an initial system design</b>. Trainees will learn how to create a design that effectively models the business domain, while being maintainable through loose coupling and high cohesion. They will also become familiar with UML notation in order to express analysis and design concepts via a common visual language. Agile concepts will also be introduced in order for students to approach design in an iterative and lightweight approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        This course combines concepts derived from the experiences of Rotati engineers, architects and analysts, as well as from the books "Applying UML and Patterns" by Craig Larman, "Analysis Patterns" by Martin Fowler, "The Data Model Resource Book" by Len Silverston, and "Data Model Patterns" by David Hay.
