        <strong>Course Overview:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Servlets and JSP are the core technologies of Java web development, and are a part of the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification. They are essential components of any web application are are at the core of Java web frameworks. JDBC is the database-access library of Java, which provides consistent data access for any database. These technologies are the basic building blocks of Java enterprise development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This course provides a rigorous introduction on these technologies as well as enterprise development in general. This course is taught by experienced, practicing Java developers. It is rich with hands-on exercises, both graded and ungraded, culminating in the whole-day machine problem. The machine problem involves building a working, deployable web application using the technologies taught in the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final day consists of a code review of the machine problem. Students present their solution to a machine problem, and their work is critiqued by the instructor as well as the rest of the class. The code review has been an effective means of driving home the lessons discussed over the past few days.
