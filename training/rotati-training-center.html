      <h3>What types of courses does Rotati Training offer?</h3>
      <h4>
        We offer software technology, startup and business strategy courses. Software courses are usually related to programming, best practices, patterns and architectures. These courses may cover Ruby, Java, Python, JavaScript and other programming languages. Our startup and business courses may relate to strategies, growth hacking, marketing tactics, analysis and so on. For example one of our most popular courses is on building a multi-million dollar mobile app startup and another is all about collecting mobile user metrics using Mixpanel. Interesting and useful courses for the tech entrepreneur!

      <h3>What skills do the students need?</h3>
      <h4>
        It depends on the course. If the course is a startup or business related course then no technical experience is required - only a sense of business acumen!
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Most of the technology courses that we run require that you already have some experience as a software developer. You have possibly worked on projects before and that you are comfortable with Internet technology and concepts. Most courses are introductory courses into technology, frameworks and patterns that maybe new and interesting to you. Some courses are also designed for gaining a deeper knowledge of a specific technology e.g Java or Rails.

      <h3>What is the training schedule?</h3>
      <h4>
        Our courses are available when you want and where you want. Most have a set number of days duration, but you can decide when you want the course to take place. In these cases it's best to get a group together so that we can offer discounts. Please note that Rotati Training require at least 6 students per course to offer this flexibility and at least 8 students or more to offer a discount.
