      <h3>HTML5 Applications</h3>
      <p>HTML5 is a way to make Mobile (and Web) applications run in a browser. By using Angular JS as the application framwork, we can build robust, fast HTML5 mobile apps in a breeze! The application is accessed by tying in a URL into the browser on the mobile phone or finding it via Google. The alternatice is to have a Hybrid / Native mobile app which is downloaded from the various app stores (see column to the right)</p>
      <h4>Charataristics</h4>
      <ul class="arrow">
       <li>Application works in the browser.</li>
       <li>Application is 'loaded' via a url</li>
       <li>User either knows the url of the application or can search for it in Google.</li>
     </ul>

    <h3>Hybrid Mobile Applications</h3>
    <p>Hybrid Mobile Applications are made with the same web technoligies as HTML5 applications (html, css and JavaScript + Angular JS), however they are converted to a (near) native applicaton for iPhone and Android. This allows for deployment of the application to the various mobile app stores.</p>
    <h4>Charataristics</h4>
    <ul class="arrow">
     <li>User installs application from app stores</li>
     <li>Application looks and feels (almost) like a pure native app (i.e. a mobile app build directly using the native technology rather that web technology)</li>
   </ul>

      <strong>Native Mobile Apps</strong><br>
      RubyMotion is always our first choice platform for building Native Mobile Apps. Its well designed, easy to use and a proven technology. The thing that we love about RubyMotion is that it allows our seasoned Ruby Developers to build real, nativly running mobile applications using the programming language they know and love, Ruby.<br><br>

      RubyMotiion allows us to use the full Ruby programming API + gems like Rake (for tasks like building etc) and be able to confidentlly test the app using RSpec. Best of all, RubyMotion is a wrapper around the native API's so that we can actually build real native apps in Ruby! RubyMotion provides a familiar environment for the Native Mobile App Developer so that they can produce clean, fast, beautiful and efficient running mobile applications.<br><br>

      <strong>Native Game development</strong><br>
      Its also possible to build games using RubyMotion using RubyMotion Game that comes included with RubyMotion. Here is an example of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/blob/master/game/FlappyBird/app/main_scene.rb">FlappyBird in 100 lines of RubyMoton</a>. We can write games using RubyMotion Game for both platforms and a single code base!<br><br>

      <strong>Testing Native Applications</strong><br>
      By using RubyMotion we have access to RSpec for testing native applications. In addition to having a suite of different Apple and Android hardware devises to hand we can also make use of very powerful, cloud based testing environments to auto test features on 100's of different devises simultaneously. Our favourite cloud based testing environment is <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/">Amazon Device Farm</a>.

      <h3>Native iOS Applications</h3>
      <p>Using RubyMotion we can build full native iOS applications. This means the application runs as fast and as efficiently as possible on the actual device. It also means we have access to the latest iOS API's to ensure that we can deliver cutting edge solutions to your application in a breeze.</p>
