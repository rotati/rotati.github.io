  <h3 class="about-section-header"><span>OUR PROCESS</span></h3>
  <h4>We take your investment seriously, and work tirelessly to ensure that your application well exceeds your expectations. Consider us your invested partners in every project that we collaborate on. Rest assured that we want to build products that work, are well tested and fit perfectly into today's market.</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3 class="text-center">Analysis and Design</h3>
      <h4>We work with you to get a solid understanding of your idea so that we can help you reach your goal. We do this by a series of discussions with you and our team of developers and designers. We create some wireframes so that you can see some of the basic beginnings of your application.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3 class="text-center">Development and Testing</h3>
      <h4>Once we understand your idea, we get going on the development. We waste no time for this and can sometimes start developing after an initial meeting with you. We can do this because we use Rails and we have mastered the ability to be agile while being focused and productive. Since we follow TDD ('test driven development') it means the entire application is tested from the outset. This ensures a solid, high quality product right from the beginning and throughout the project.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3 class="text-center">Deployment and Maintenance</h3>
      <h4>We deploy early and often. We love feedback and we love to get things just right. The best way to do that is to deploy and let you give us your feedback so we can fine tune your idea into exactly what you expect. We also maintain the application during the project and beyond to ensure that your application can continue to serve your users at all times.</h4>
