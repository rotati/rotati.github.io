         <h3>Angular JS is always our first choice, client-side framework for building Mobile Apps. Its well designed, easy to use and a proven technology. Here is a brief explaination of the two types of Mobile Applications that we build here at Rotati!</h3>

        <h3>HTML5 Applications</h3>
        <p>HTML5 is a way to make Mobile (and Web) applications run in a browser. By using Angular JS as the application framwork, we can build robust, fast HTML5 mobile apps in a breeze! The application is accessed by tying in a URL into the browser on the mobile phone or finding it via Google. The alternatice is to have a Hybrid / Native mobile app which is downloaded from the various app stores (see column to the right)</p>
        <h4>Charataristics</h4>
        <ul class="arrow">
         <li>Application works in the browser.</li>
         <li>Application is 'loaded' via a url</li>
         <li>User either knows the url of the application or can search for it in Google.</li>
       </ul>

      <h3>Hybrid Mobile Applications</h3>
      <p>Hybrid Mobile Applications are made with the same web technoligies as HTML5 applications (html, css and JavaScript + Angular JS), however they are converted to a (near) native applicaton for iPhone and Android. This allows for deployment of the application to the various mobile app stores.</p>
      <h4>Charataristics</h4>
      <ul class="arrow">
       <li>User installs application from app stores</li>
       <li>Application looks and feels (almost) like a pure native app (i.e. a mobile app build directly using the native technology rather that web technology)</li>
